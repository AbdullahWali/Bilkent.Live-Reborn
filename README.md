#####The Bilkent.live application is developed with the aim of helping the Bilkent University staff and students move around the campus comfortably.

* Enjoy faster access to necessary information about living on campus.

* Check whether a restaurant or a cafe on campus is open or not easily, and check opening - closing times.

* Navigation to all premises on campus, including the restaurants and cafes is made easier through Google Maps integration at the application.

* Know the time it takes for the shuttle buses to leave or arrive to campus. Check the time remaining for the bus to leave, take a friend and go have something in the city.
